# Seattle History

Seattle, a major port city with a history of boom and bust, was settled by the Denny Party in 1851 and has been inhabited for at least 4,000 years. The city has experienced several cycles of growth and decline, influenced by events such as the Klondike Gold Rush, World War I, the Boeing boom, and the rise of tech companies like Microsoft and Amazon.

Currently Seattle is experiencing an unprecedented boom.
