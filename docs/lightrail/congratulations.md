# Congratulations

The Seattle Light Rail System provides a fast and reliable mode of
transportation, with trains running every 6 to 15 minutes, depending on the time
of day. Notably, it connects downtown Seattle to Sea-Tac Airport, making it
convenient for both residents and visitors to travel to and from the airport
without the hassle of driving or parking.
