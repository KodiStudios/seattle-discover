The Microsoft Thermal Energy Center, located in Redmond, Washington, is the
centerpiece of Microsoftâ€™s new campus expansion. This energy plant, one of the
largest geothermal energy plants in North America, uses hundreds of geothermal
wells drilled 550 feet into the ground to power the campus almost entirely
through electricity provided by geothermal energy exchanges.
